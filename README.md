# üß± Rocky Migration Lab

## Overview
This repository documents the setup and testing of a CentOS 7 ‚Üí Rocky Linux 9 modernization lab environment using **KVM** and **libvirt** on Ubuntu 22.04.  
The goal is to simulate a real-world modernization workflow: migrating a legacy CentOS 7 system to a Rocky Linux 9 target while maintaining full network connectivity, SSH access, and reproducibility.

**Workload**
- **Application:** Prometheus + Node Exporter  
- **Container Platform:** Docker 26.1.4 + Docker Compose v2.27.0

- **Status:** Running and validated in browser  

**Validation**
- Prometheus reachable at [http://192.168.122.87:9090](http://192.168.122.87:9090)  
- Node Exporter metrics available at [http://192.168.122.87:9100/metrics](http://192.168.122.87:9100/metrics)  
- Verified Docker daemon active and containers listed with `docker ps`  

**Snapshot Created**  

**Artifacts Captured**
- `snapshots/legacy-centos7.xml` (VM definition)  
- `snapshots/virbr0.xml` (Network definition)  
- `/home/eden/prom-stack/` (Docker configs)  
- Browser validation successful  

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Phase 3 ‚Äî Ansible Migration Simulation
**Purpose:** Demonstrate an automated migration workflow between legacy CentOS 7 and Rocky 9 using Ansible.

**Workflow**
1. Configured `ansible.cfg` and `inventory.ini` for both VMs.  
2. Verified connectivity with `ansible -m ping all`.  
3. Created playbook `migrate.yml` to simulate a config transfer:  
   - Fetched `/etc/hosts` from CentOS 7  
   - Deployed it to Rocky Linux 9 via delegation  
4. Verified successful run (`changed = 1`) showing automated migration.  

**Outcome**
‚úÖ Working automation demonstration reflecting CIQ-style modernization and cross-environment reproducibility.  

**Artifacts Captured**
- `ansible/playbooks/precheck.yml`  
- `ansible/playbooks/migrate.yml`  
- `docs/migration-summary.md`  

---

## üîí Phase 4 ‚Äî Security Hardening & Validation
**Purpose:** Validate system integrity and align the Rocky 9 VM with CIQ‚Äôs RLC-Hardened standards.

**Steps**
1. Enforced SELinux and confirmed with `getenforce` ‚Üí `reports/selinux_status.txt`  
2. Enabled `firewalld` and verified it‚Äôs active ‚Üí `reports/firewalld_status.txt`  
3. Ran `rpm -Va --nofiles --noscripts` for package integrity ‚Üí `reports/rpm_verify.txt`  
4. Documented findings in `docs/hardening-validation.md`.

**CIQ Alignment**
- Mirrors CIQ‚Äôs **RLC-Hardened** baseline (SELinux, Firewalld, signed package integrity).  
- Reflects **Lifecycle Validation** by ensuring no unauthorized drift in system binaries.  
- Ties directly into CIQ‚Äôs FIPS 140-3 readiness and compliance posture.  

**Artifacts**
- `docs/hardening-validation.md`  
- `reports/selinux_status.txt`  
- `reports/firewalld_status.txt`  
- `reports/rpm_verify.txt`

---

## üìà Phase 5 ‚Äî Benchmark + Validation
**Purpose:** Measure CPU performance post-migration and confirm no degradation occurred compared to CentOS 7.

**Steps**
1. Installed Sysbench (`dnf install -y sysbench`).  
2. Executed `sysbench cpu run` and captured ‚Üí `reports/sysbench-rocky9.txt`.  
3. (Optional) Ran the same test on CentOS 7 for comparison ‚Üí `reports/sysbench-centos7.txt`.  
4. Documented results in `docs/benchmark-summary.md`.

**CIQ Alignment**
- Reflects CIQ‚Äôs **Lifecycle Validation** testing pipeline ‚Äî regression and performance validation before image release.  
- Demonstrates modernization consistency under CIQ‚Äôs lifecycle management.  

**Artifacts**
- `docs/benchmark-summary.md`  
- `reports/sysbench-rocky9.txt`  
- `reports/sysbench-centos7.txt` (optional)

---

## ‚òÅÔ∏è Phase 6 ‚Äî Cloud Portability Simulation (Terraform Stub)
**Purpose:** Illustrate cloud readiness and hybrid consistency using Terraform as a declarative IaC framework.

**Stub Overview**
- File: `terraform/rocky9_cloud.tf`  
- Defines AWS provider configuration and a placeholder EC2 instance.  
- Non-functional (no AMI or credentials) ‚Äî demonstrates structure only.

**CIQ Alignment**
- Reflects CIQ‚Äôs **Hybrid Consistency** model ‚Äî Rocky can be deployed and managed identically across on-prem and cloud.  
- Simulates **Lifecycle Management as Code**, foundational to CIQ‚Äôs infrastructure automation approach.  

**Artifacts**
- `terraform/rocky9_cloud.tf`  
- `docs/cloud-portability.md`

2. Highlight migration automation (`ansible-playbook migrate.yml`).  
3. Display hardening & validation outputs (`reports/selinux_status.txt`, `firewalld_status.txt`).  
4. Review benchmark results (`reports/sysbench-rocky9.txt`).  
5. End with the Terraform stub to illustrate CIQ‚Äôs hybrid consistency message.

## üß† Key Takeaway
This lab simulates CIQ‚Äôs modernization approach:  
**Migration ‚Üí Automation ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Lifecycle ‚Üí Portability.**  
Rocky Linux delivers the open-source foundation, while CIQ provides the hardened, lifecycle-managed, and hybrid-consistent ecosystem around it.
